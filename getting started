}

ANS-This problem has only one correct answer
code
Error
check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer -- Error
Solution Description
If we want to print something on screen exactly, we need to put that text in double quotes, otherwise error will come. For eg. cout << "code";

What will be the output of the following code ?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "career" << "labs";
}
This problem has only one correct answer
careerlabs
career labs
check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer - careerlabs
Solution Description
The text will be printed exactly like we placed inside double quotes. So first we are printing "career". After printing, our cursor will be right next to the 'r' of "carrer". So "labs" will be printed right next to the "career" without any spaces between them


Which of the following data type stores longest decimal number ?

This problem has only one correct answer
long
float
double
short
check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer - double
Solution Description
Out of all given options, only float and double can hold decimal numbers. Size of the float is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes (in most of the compilers, as the size of data types is compiler specific). So double can store bigger decimal numbers

What will be the output of following statements -
bool a = true;
cout << a;
Answer
1
Correct Answer
Solution Description
In c++, when we print the value of a bool variable, it prints either 0 (for false) or 1 (for true). It doesn't print "true" or "false".



What is the output of the following code if the input is : 5 15?
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
        int a, b; 
    cin >> a;
    cin >> b;
    cout << (a+b);
            return 0;
            This problem has only one correct answer
5
15
20
Error
check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer - 20
Solution Description
We are asking two integer values from user and input is "5 15" (without quotes). So 5 will be assigned to a and 15 will be assigned to b. We can enter multiple input values either separated by space or in new lines. 
Hence, the result will be 20

What is the output of the following code if the input is : 2 10.1 D ?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int a;
    double d;
    char c;
    cin >> a >> d >> c;
    cout << a << d << c << endl;
This problem has only one correct answer
2 10.1 D
2
210.1D
Error
check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer - 210.1D
Solution Description
We are taking 3 inputs - one integer, one double and one character value. And our input is : "2 10.1 D" (without quotes). So, 2 will be assigned to a, 10.1 will be assigned to d and D will be assigned to c.
We can enter multiple input values either separated by space or in new lines. 
Then we are printing all the three values one by one, without any space between them. So ans is : 210.1D

What will be the output of following statement ?
 cout << (‘a’ + 1)
 Answer
98
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When you add a character and an integer, answer is also an integer. It will add the ASCII value of  char ‘a’ i.e 97  and int 1. So answer will be 98.

What will be the output of following statement ?
int i = 'c';
cout << i;
Answer
99
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When we put char 'c' into an integer, its ASCII value will be put in the integer i.e. 99.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
       char c = 74;
       cout << c;
       return 0;
Answer
J
Correct Answer
Solution Description
When we assign an integer to a character variable, that integer will be treated as ASCII value of corresponding character. 74 is ASCII value of letter 'J'. Hence, 'J' will be printed.

What is the output ?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    char ch = 'a';
    ch = ch + a;
    cout << ch << endl;
Answer
k
Correct Answer
Solution Description
We know that the addition of a character and an integer leads to an integer. So the statement - "ch + a" will give the answer 107 (ASCII value of 'a' is 97). But we are assigning this integer now to the character variable. Hence, 107 will be saved in the variable "ch" and on printing it will print the character which is having ASCII value 107 i.e. 'k'

check_circle
Hurray! Correct Answer - 2
Solution Description
When 6 / 4 is performed, both the operands of / are int hence answer will be an int i.e. 1. Hence the value of both a and b is 1. Thus a + b will be 2. In C++, if a double value doesn't contain any decimal value, only integer will be printed
