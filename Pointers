Assume the memory address of variable ‘a’ is 400 (and an integer takes 4 bytes), what will be the output -
int a = 7;
int *c = &a;
c = c + 3;
cout<< c << endl;
Answer
412
Correct Answer
Solution Description
c stores address of a (and points to value of a). address that c stores is incremented by 3. since c is of type int, increment in bytes is 3 integer addresses, that is 3*4 = 12 bytes. therefore 400 + 12 = 412

Solution Description
 p points to a. q points to p directly and a through p (double pointer). *q — value stored in p is changed to address of b instead of that of a. (*p)++ — value that p points to, which now is of b, is incremented by 1 (b becomes 21). Value of a remains unchanged.
