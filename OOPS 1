Garbage value - answer
Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
####Height and width are initialised to 5 and 4 respectively but length is not initialised. Default value for an integer data member of a class is garbage value, hence length contains garbage value. Volume will thus be garbage value.

What will be the output of the following code ?
#include <iostream>

class Student{
    public :

    }
};

int main() {
    Student s(12);
    s.print();
}
Answer
12
Correct Answer
Solution Description
####Constructor is called when an object is created, here when we create a Student object, corresponding student object is created and rollNo is assigned to 12. So output is 12.

GarbageValue 15
Compilation Error - answer
Hurray! Correct Answer
Solution Description
####There is Compilation error - “constructor Student() is undefined” because the default constructor is available only till the point we don’t create our own constructor. So Student class has only one constructor which require roll number as argument, hence we should pass integer as argument while creating any Student object.

Complex Number Class
Send Feedback
A ComplexNumber class contains two data members : one is the real part (R) and the other is imaginary (I) (both integers).
Implement the Complex numbers class that contains following functions -
1. constructor
You need to create the appropriate constructor.
2. plus -
This function adds two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.
e.g.
if C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 3 +i1
C1.plus(C2) results in: 
C1 = 7 + i6 and C2 = 3 + i1
3. multiply -
This function multiplies two given complex numbers and updates the first complex number.
e.g.
if C1 = 4 + i5 and C2 = 1 + i2
C1.multiply(C2) results in: 
C1 = -6 + i13 and C2 = 1 + i2
4. print -
This function prints the given complex number in the following format :
a + ib
Note : There is space before and after '+' (plus sign) and no space between 'i' (iota symbol) and b.
Input Format :
Line 1 : Two integers - real and imaginary part of 1st complex number
Line 2 : Two integers - real and imaginary part of 2nd complex number
Line 3 : An integer representing choice (1 or 2) (1 represents plus function will be called and 2 represents multiply function will be called)
Output format :
Check details of 'print' function given above.
Sample Input 1 :
4 5
6 7

Sample Output 1 :
10 + i12
Sample Input 2 :
