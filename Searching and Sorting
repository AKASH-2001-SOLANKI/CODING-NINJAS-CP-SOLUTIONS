Code Binary Search
Send Feedback
You have been given a sorted(in ascending order) integer array/list(ARR) of size N and an element X. Write a function to search this element in the given input array/list using 'Binary Search'. Return the index of the element in the input array/list. In case the element is not present in the array/list, then return -1.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 'N' which denotes the size of the array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.

Third line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow..

All the 't' lines henceforth, will take the value of X to be searched for in the array/list.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the index at which X is present, -1 otherwise.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^4
0 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= X <= 10^9

Push Zeros to end
Send Feedback
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it. Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note:
Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.

You need to do this in one scan of array only. Don't use extra space.


Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the elements of the array/list in the desired order separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.

Sum of Two Arrays
Send Feedback
Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an integer in itself of digits N and M.
You need to find the sum of both the input arrays/list treating them as two integers and put the result in another array/list i.e. output array/list will also contain only single digit at every index.
Note:
The sizes N and M can be different. 

Output array/list(of all 0s) has been provided as a function argument. Its size will always be one more than the size of the bigger array/list. Place 0 at the 0th index if there is no carry. 

No need to print the elements of the output array/list.
Using the function "sumOfTwoArrays", write the solution to the problem and store the answer inside this output array/list. The main code will handle the printing of the output on its own.
Input format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first array/list.

Third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.

Fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the required sum of the arrays/list in a row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
